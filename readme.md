# Bonfire Theme

This repository holds the working version of the in-development theme for Bonfire Next. The theme will be free for anyone to use for any project, though it will be tailored for use with Bonfire, obviously. The goal is to provide a clean, elegant theme that provides many of the portions that any project will need. 

> Please note: It is in very early development stage currently, and not suitable for use in projects. If you want to watch it, then by all means! 

The theme uses the following third-party elements: 

- [Foundation CSS Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Eldarion AJAX](https://github.com/eldarion/eldarion-ajax)
- [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

Intended to be built with [CodeKit 2](https://incident57.com/codekit/)
